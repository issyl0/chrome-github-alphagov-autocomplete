Scratching an itch, as they say. I made a Chrome Extension.

For almost two years now, I've been annoyed at Google Search results
or "could not resolve host" errors when typing `alphagov/repo-name`
into Google Chrome's Omnibox. I decided to fix it so that typing
`alphagov/repo-name` would autocomplete to
`https://github.com/alphagov/repo-name`, no matter whether that repo
exists or not.
